            Explanation: 
            variables:
            user = input used to hold a name of user, this is later used to send a message with their name in it later
            weapon = input from user of which weapon they would like to take
            temp = stores the input of what weapon they would like as a string therefore so that it can be tested to see if it can be converted to an integer or not
            a = kinda forgot how to do the do while loop so I created another variable and that sorta fixed it
            monsterArray = holds the three monsters that are randomly generated (see later)
            rnd = didn't know how to do a random value so I googled it don't really know if this is needed or not
            numMonster = set to a random number which then correlates to the index of the array to get a random monster
            monster = the end string of the random monster
            what I did:
            created the name system just by using writelines and one variable
            more writelines of available weapons which then using a readline and if statements allows a user to pick one having different outcomes with each
            temp value used to create a system so that data can be checked to be the correct format and if not an error message is sent
            monster variable is used with an if statement to do invidivual outcomes on certain scenarios
